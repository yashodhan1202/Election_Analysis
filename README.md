## Summary

This script can be easily modified to fit any type of election. For example, if you wanted to do analysis of a federal congressional election, all you need to do is change the counties to states. Another example, if you had to analyze a sales quantities of a company, the votes would have to be changed to sales quantites, candidates to name of the products and counties to place sold.
